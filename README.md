## Development

### Supabase Backend

This project uses a Supabase Backend. Make sure you have set up the corresponding Supabase environment variables in the `.env.local` file.
You can use the official public `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY` environment variables for this.
### How to build and run
Run `npm install` in order to install all necessary dependencies.

After that you can simply run `npm run dev`


## Notes

This is my first time working with Svelte. I created this for fun, the code is horrible but at least it's fast :)
